#Module 10 Challenge
# Mission To Mars
## Overview
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter the goal is to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate such images. By doing so, Robin's web app will look even better 
## Results
•	Through Deliverable 1, all desired details were stored on the dictionary 
![ hemisphere image and titles]( https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/M10_Mission_To_Mars/blob/main/Del1.png)
•	In Deliverable 2 the ![scraping.py]( https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/M10_Mission_To_Mars/blob/main/scraping.py) file allows the retrieval of the full resolution image url and title for each of the hemisphere images and the ![index.html]( https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/M10_Mission_To_Mars/commit/b1164fda2b95a13e0a11fdd6f676c8fb0b7ac3d7) has now the code to display the full resolution and title of the hemisphere images. 
•	Responsiveness and additional boostrap3 component was added to the style of the site on Deliverable 3

The usage of flask proved to be a bit challenging throughout the process.
